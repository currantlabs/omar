/*
 * Using a couple of different esp32 development boards
 * while waiting for actual omar hardware to arrive.
 *
 * Depending on which dev board is being used, some gpio
 * assignemnts etc. will change.
 *
 * HW_ESP32_DEVKITC
 * Refers to the "ESP32-DevKitC development board", the
 * devboard we were given to use during GridConnect 
 * esp32 training up in SF on Oct 18-19 2018. Works 
 * fine but is built around the ESP-WROOM-32 module,
 * which is different from the module we'll be using
 * with actual omar hardware
 *
 * HW_ESP32_PICOKIT
 * Refers to the "ESP32-PICO-KIT development board"
 * which resembles actual omar hardware because they 
 * both use the same esp32 module, the ESP32-PICO-D4.
 * The set of gpios available to play with on the
 * HW_ESP32_PICOKIT more closely resembles those 
 * available on the actual omar hardware
