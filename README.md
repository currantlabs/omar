# Omar #

----------

A home for the Omar hardware bring-up code. Initially this will consist of a menu of console commands for testing the various hardware components (based on the esp-idf SDK's `console`).

This version of Omar is built around the Espressif ESP32, and you can find everything you need to know about the ESP32 platform and the esp-idf SDK used to build code for it here: [ESP-IDF Programming Guide](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/).
